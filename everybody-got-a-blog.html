                <p>About ten years ago the then CEO of Johnston Press paid a visit to our regional newsroom and asked the reporters if they had a blog. Puzzled looks prevailed. Since then we have become a nation of bloggers and everyone from journalists to stay at home mums has found an online vehicle for their views. Having a blog is easy. Keeping it up to date and making it work for you is quite another. </p>

                <h2>Make it different</h2>
                <p>What blogs do you enjoy reading most? Well written ones? Visual ones? Finding your style is one thing but making yours stand out from the millions of blogs out there takes thought. Find a niche that really interests you - writing what you know is always easier than writing what you think people want to hear. If your passion comes across, you'll naturally differentiate yourself from the crowd.</p>

                <h2>Keep it regular</h2>
                <p>There's no point having a blog that was last updated 168 days ago, especially if it's a blog that's attached to your business website. Make a diary note to update it weekly or monthly. If it's really becoming a problem employ a writer to create a weekly blog and then add your own blogs whenever you feel inspired.</p>

                <h2>Give it a great headline </h2>
                <p>A strong marketing message needs to engage, whether it's the subject line of your e-shot or the headline of your blog. As a journalist I understand the power of a headline more than most. A reader is attracted by the headline to read the first paragraph. A strong first paragraph then draws the reader into the rest of the story. A powerful ending leaves them with something to take away. Add to that the fact that blogs are often discovered through Google searches or crowded Twitter feeds and the importance of a headline that speaks to people becomes all the more apparent.</p>

                <h2>Keep it short </h2>
                <p>But not too short. There are people who love nothing more than to spend hours reading lengthy blogs, reviews and in-depth newspaper features but there are many more who do not. Five or six strong paragraphs should be enough to get your point across and it also helps to break the text up with subheadings, images and even infographics.</p>

                <h2>Be careful who you quote</h2>
                <p>As a professional blogger, I write regularly for many different businesses and individuals on a variety of themes and often quote other experts or articles. The number one rule is to make sure the person or website that's being quoted isnâ€™t in the same line of business as the person you're blogging for. It's not wise to give blog space to the competition!</p>
