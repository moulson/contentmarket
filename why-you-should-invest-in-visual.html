                <p>Online content is highly visual. Every story should have an image to draw readers in and help them identify with the content. 
                There are plenty of free online image resources but every now and then you'll want a personalised image that represents your brand in a way that's truly unique. 
                Investing in professional photography sets your website, marketing and online content apart. If you're submitting articles or press releases to publications a good image can make the difference between a                 story being used or not.
                </p>
                <h3>PR Images</h3></br>
                <p>A specialist PR photographer will capture an image on location featuring the key people in the news story. A line up of people captured on a phone camera is unlikely to appeal to a journalist in the same way as a well-structured, professionally shot group image with a recognizable backdrop.</p>
                <h3>Video</h3></br>
                <p>Video allows you to say something about your brand or service. It can show people a snapshot of your business in operation and the personality of the people that work there. It's a powerful and engaging way to introduce yourself and what you do.</p>
        
                <h3>Picture Power</h3></br>
                <p>In this era of online media many journalists will pick on an average story with a great image rather than a good story with a poor image, or no image at all. The reason is simple. A journalist has spaces to fill online and on paper and most online stories require an image. In print, a good image can make the difference between your story being selected or not, and a really good image could mean it receives greater prominence simply because it helpsÂ provide a focus on the page or improves the layout.</p>
                <h3>Product Shots</h3></br>
                <p>If you are promoting lifestyle products - fashion, home or beauty for example - a great product shot plus a few descriptive lines arriving in the journalist's inbox just at the right time could mean your product will be included in a lifestyle feature or beauty update page simply because you've been in the right place at the right time - with the right eye-catching image.</p>
                <h3>Finding a photographer</h3></br>
                <p>Source a good photographer and request a selection of shots that could be used for different types of press releases. As well as product shots make sure you have images of yourself taken with your products, plus a good head and shoulders shot of you that can be used for advice columns or more serious news stories. Once you have the images you can hang onto them and select the best picture for each piece of PR, social media and content marketing you distribute.</p>
                <h3>Planning a shoot</h3></br>
                <p>Make sure you think carefully about the types of content marketing you're likely to need before booking your photo session so that you can have as much taken as possible in one sitting. Product shots will obviously need updating as you release new ranges, but your stock marketing shots can be used over and over again.</p>
                <p>Photography may be an expensive investment, but it will definitely be money well spent</p>
