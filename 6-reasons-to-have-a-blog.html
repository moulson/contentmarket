                <p>You've been told it's a good idea to have a blog on your website but now it's there you never seem to find the time to write anything.
                    When you do find a spare moment you can't decide what to write or how to begin.</p>

                <p>In fact, you can't even remember the point of having a blog on your website in the first place.</p>

                <p>Well, here's a little reminder:</p>

                <p><span class="blog-bullet"><strong>It will help you talk to your customers.</strong></span> A good blog that's written well and uses the sorts of key words and phrases that your customers might be searching for is a powerful way of communicating to your target audience.</p>
                <p><span>It's a platform for shouting about your success.</span> How often have you wished there was a quick and easy way to let people know about an event you're attending,
                    a new product or service you're launching or something exciting that's happening in your business?
                    A blog or news page is the perfect place for these updates.</p>
                
                <p><span><strong>It will feed your social media.</strong></span> If you're struggling with a blog then Twitter, Facebook,
                    LinkedIn and Instagram are probably areas of your marketing that also need attention.
                    Your blog will give you plenty of material to share on social media and lots of links that will attract people to your website.</p>

                <p><span><strong>It will make your website more relevant.</strong></span> As well as the obvious advantages of having relevant, fresh content to improve your search rankings and visibility online,
                    an up to date and interesting blog will keep people on your website for longer and reassure them that this is a business that is active, innovative and successful in its field.</p>
                
                <p><span><strong>It's a way of positioning you as an expert.</strong></span> People buy from people and they use brands and businesses that they know, like and trust. 
                    Your blog is a way to show your personality and shout about your values.
                    
                <p><span><strong>It will allow you to influence your market.</strong></span> Once you're writing regular and informative blogs and are sharing them via LinkedIn, Twitter and other social media sites
                    as well as on your own website, you will have created a significant sphere of influence. This audience is not only listening to you, it's sitting up and paying attention.
                    And if you're doing it really well, your audience is engaging and commenting on your posts. This type of feedback from customers and contacts is invaluable if you are to
                    remain relevant and competitive in your key markets.</p>
