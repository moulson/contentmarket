                <p>Anyone who runs a business knows that appearances are important.</p>
                <p>We all like to say we don't judge a book by its cover - we take the time to get to know someone before deciding whether we like them.
                That may be true of people, but what about businesses?</p>

                <p>Imagine you're planning to eat out at a restaurant. You have five to choose from, and the first one you come to looks shabby on the outside. 
                    The staff aren't wearing uniforms, the tables are empty and it doesn't seem to have a menu by the door to tell you more about it.
                    Do you keep trying to find something to like about it, or do you just move on to somewhere else?</p>

                <h2>First impressions count</h2>
                <p>From the quality of your branding to the sharpness of your suit, people will judge your business on what they can see 
                    - and will turn to your rivals if it's not up to scratch. This probably isn't a revelation if you've been in business
                    for a long time. Whenever you are representing your business, you make choices about how you appear, to make sure you impress potential clients and customers.</br>
                    For example, if you were an accountant and you went to a networking event, you would probably choose to wear a suit and tie or a smart dress.
                    Not only does this give a professional impression, it also helps you to feel confident when dealing with other business owners.
                    If you turned up in jeans, an un-ironed shirt or a creased jacket, what impression would you give? Others would probably think
                    you are unprofessional, perhaps disorganised, and that you don't have much respect for yourself or the event.</p>

                <h2>Word power</h2>
                <p>Now consider what your marketing content, such as your website, brochure or social media, says about you. Is it as professional as it could be
                - and does it sell your business to people without you having to be there to do it yourself?
                When it comes to marketing, first rate spelling and grammar, and well-written, engaging copy, are just as important as striking images and flashy design.
                Something as simple as missing apostrophes on your website can be the online equivalent of turning up to a business meeting in scruffy trainers:
                it suggests you don't respect the other person, you can't be bothered to make the right impression and you don't think it's important to get things right.</p>

                <h2>Remember:</h2>
                <p>If you want your business to look as professional as you do, you need to get your words right. Otherwise, you might as well just wear pyjamas to work from now on.</p>
