                Business awards can be a great way of showcasing what your business offers, what it has achieved and where it's heading. They can help you gain publicity, raise your profile, and boost staff morale.
                <br/>
                That's why, as part of our work in creating a comprehensive PR strategy for our clients, we will, where appropriate, recommend that they enter an award. We can even write their nomination form for them!
                <br/>
                But you need to choose your awards wisely, and recognise that entry forms can vary widely in the amount of detail they require. In some cases, entering an award can be a time-consuming process. So is it really worth the hassle?
                </p>
                <h2>Things to consider</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">
                There is a wealth of business awards out there, all recognising and celebrating the successes of companies large and small. They range from local, to regional and national awards. Some are industry-based, some are run by newspapers or websites. Some cover specific sectors, some are aimed at start-ups, some focus on products or customer satisfaction, some on business growth. Not every award is the same, and not every one is suitable for every business.
                <br/>
				So the first thing to ask yourself is: "Which award is the right one for my business?"
                <br/>
                It is key that you enter awards that will ultimately place you in front of the audience your business is trying to reach. If the awards are run by a trade publication, for instance, they will more than likely only reach other business people in that sector. That's great if your company deals on a B2B basis, or if you want to position yourself as a leader in your sector.
                <br/>
                If, however, the awards are run by a local newspaper, it's likely that the reader demographic will be both local business people and residents. This could be good if your business is B2C, or if you trade mainly in your local area.
                <br/>
                Business awards tend to have a variety of categories and, again, it is vital that you choose wisely. Ask yourself which category - or categories - will best demonstrate your business's strengths to your desired audience.
                <br/>

                <h2>The benefits</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">
							 <h3>1 - It could raise your profile</h3>
							 <br/>
							 This is particularly true if you get shortlisted - and even more so if you win. Finalists are often profiled before the awards evening, and the overall winners may even be the subject of further features and news articles. Remember to take full advantage of the PR opportunities and increased brand awareness that a win brings with it, and make sure you display your accolade on your website, in your literature, on your shop window, on social media and on press releases.
<br/>
							 <h3>2 - It's free advertising</h3>
<br/>
							 If you do get shortlisted and are profiled in more detail, you can talk about a new product or service you've launched, show how you've expanded or grab the opportunity to promote yourself to a new audience.
<br/>
							 <h3>3 - It's a good networking opportunity</h3>
<br/>
							 Representatives of the shortlisted businesses and the award sponsors will usually attend the awards ceremony, giving you the chance to introduce yourself to some key business contacts.
<br/>
							 <h3>4 - It boosts staff morale</h3>
<br/>
							 Having your company praised by the judges not only gives you a sense of pride in what you've achieved, but also gives everyone on your team recognition for their hard work. Some awards even have an Employee of the Year category for those members of staff who have made a valued contribution to your business.
<br/>
							 And don't forget: If you're shortlisted, you could thank your team members for their hard work by inviting them to share in the celebrations at the awards ceremony.
<br/>
							 <h3>5 - It gives you a chance to assess your business</h3>
<br/>
							 Most good business awards will require you to fill out an entry form, and if you're shortlisted you may also have to present your company in more detail before a judging panel.
<br/>
							 This process will inevitably make you stand back from your everyday duties and appraise your business as a whole. Depending how detailed the form is, it can give you a valuable insight into your business's strengths and weaknesses. It can help you identify areas for improvement, and think about your plans for the future.
<br/>
							 <h3>6 - It compares you to your competition</h3>
<br/>
							 The other companies in the category you've entered are likely to be similar to yours in size and sector. Being shortlisted will allow you to check out your rivals, as well as finding out at the awards ceremony what the judges ultimately thought of you all.
<br/>
							 <h3>7 - It makes your company look good against the competition</h3>
<br/>
							 Winning an award will differentiate you from your competition and highlight you as the best - and that's great news for your current customers. It's also a big attraction for potential clients, investors and high calibre employees.
<br/>
							 <h3>8 - It's fun!</h3>
<br/>
							 Attending the awards ceremony as a finalist can be exciting, fun, daunting and thrilling - and that's before you find out if you've won!
