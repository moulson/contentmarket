                <p>There's no doubt that social media can be a powerful marketing tool if it's done well but should businesses opt for in-house or outsourced social media management?</p>

<p>Whether you're a hotel or guest house looking to promote last minute availability or a brand seeking to build awareness across a wider audience, social media marketing has been proven to give a far higher return on investment than traditional channels like newspaper advertising and email marketing.</p>

<p>The problem for most businesses is finding time to do it properly and, once they've decided to prioritise it, deciding whether to hire someone in-house or opt for an outsourced service.</p>

<h3><b>Here are some of the pros and cons of outsourcing:</b></h3>

	<ul> <h4>Pros:</h4>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">Agencies are social media specialists and are familiar with the latest tools for measuring engagement, the best times to tweet to your audience and the best hashtags for your industry. </li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">They have experience of running campaigns and building followers and will know what works best, saving time and getting things off the ground quickly.</li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">They can plan your content to complement other marketing activity or seasonal initiatives for maximum impact.</li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">If you happen to have a busy week or two, your social media still gets done if it's outsourced. Your agency will make sure it's a priority even if you can't. </li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">The time you would have spent managing social media can be put to use on other areas of your business. </li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">Your social media activity will be more strategic and sustained. </li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">Your agency will be able to provide reports that demonstrate the effectiveness of each post, channel and campaign.</li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">Overall, outsourced social media tends to be a more cost-effective option than in-house management for most businesses once they have grown beyond start-up stage. </li>
	</ul>
	<ul> <h4>Cons:</h4>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">Good communication is essential if outsourced social media management is to work. A good agency will telephone you or email weekly for an update on latest business activity and priorities. </li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">Your social media voice may be different if it is managed by an agency. To avoid this, work with your account manager for the first few weeks to establish a tone and style that you're comfortable with.</li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">Your agency may not always be able to react quickly to things that are happening in your business such as event highlights, last minute bargains or late availability. These types of spur of the moment posts are vital for developing a dynamic brand. Even if your social media is being outsourced, have an arrangement with your agency that you will occasionally post in-house when something timely happens.</li>
		<li style="margin-top: 10px">When customer service issues arise online they need dealing with promptly. If you're not tuned into your own social media these can easily be missed and a small issue can become a huge one. If you manage your social media in-house have alerts set up so that any mention of your brand is picked up immediately. If you outsource social media make sure your agency does the same and agree a crisis management policy with them so that they can handle things professionally on your behalf. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><h3><b>So, is it worth outsourcing your social media?</b></h3></p>
	<p>Social media is, by nature, a dialogue and the best way to achieve results is by developing a personality and tone that communicates your brand message to as wide a range of potential customers as possible. Outsourcing means your social media is professionally managed and monitored and stops it from becoming a chore. However, it can only be truly successful if the agency you choose does it the way you would, taking time to understand your business and keeping in touch with you regularly.</p>
