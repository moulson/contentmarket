                    <h4 class="center">Katie</h4>
                    <p>During her 12-year career as a journalist, Katie honed her skills in writing, editing, proofreading and page design by working in a variety of roles, including reporter, sub editor, news editor and business editor.</p><span class="collapse" id="katie"><p>
                    Working on the five paid-for titles in the Harrogate Advertiser Series, as well as a wide range of its magazines and supplements, Katie experienced and helped facilitate many changes, including the transfer from broadsheet to tabloid format, and the increasing use of digital media such                          as the website, Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>
                    Before pursuing a career in journalism, Katie had gained a first class honours degree in German and Linguistics from the University of Manchester. She then moved to Berlin, where she became a fluent German speaker. Upon her return to England, she undertook a postgraduate journalism course                       at Sheffield College.</p><p>
                    She left the Harrogate Advertiser Series in June 2015 to pursue a freelance career, and has already undertaken PR and copywriting work for Transdev and the WISE Campaign, as well as writing blogs for recruitment and renewable energy companies.</p>
                    <p>Away from work, Katie keeps active by playing netball, which is not nearly as energy-zapping as her other main form of exercise: running round after her three young children.</p></span><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#katie" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="katie"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign"></span></a>

She joined the Harrogate Advertiser straight after college and worked on its sister titles in Nidderdale and Wetherby over the following few years.</p><span class="collapse" id="vicky"><p> After completing her NCE (senior journalism exams) with flying colours - including winning a handful of awards - she became chief reporter of the Harrogate Advertiser.</p> <p>Vicky helped to see the Advertiser through a period of rapid and extensive change, including transferring to a new production system and changing from broadsheet to tabloid. She then decided to go it alone and became a freelance journalist, PR consultant and copywriter in August 2012. Since then, she has worked long-term for the Yorkshire Post's business desk on its prestigious Yorkshire Vision magazine, as well as writing for publications including Dalesman, Big Issue in the North, Guardian Northerner, Interweave and Woman's Own. Her PR and copywriting clients have included dentists, restaurants, cake decorators, bridal shops, accountants, care providers, schools, hotels, choirs and many others.
